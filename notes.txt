----------------------------------------

general flow of data for each source
    pull 1 file per table per source
    organize into folder structure source/table
    compress each source table file independently (keep these files between 10 - 100 MB)
    push each compressed file to snowflake stage
    unpack each file sent to snowflake stage into appropriate location in repo



questions:
    flat file vs json (is json going to be more flexible for source changes???)
